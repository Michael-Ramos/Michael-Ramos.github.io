# Web Design 1
Clone this repo to your computer and complete the tasks in this repo as Mr. Docket instructs you to. If you missed, [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) will help you to create your github pages account.

### Web Design 1-1
Use the skills you learned from the *Resources 1.1* folder and lecture 1.1 to create a basic webpage (.html file) version of your resume and place it in your github pages in a folder called "1-1." You should have headlines, lists, and paragraphs formatted neatly into a simple page.

### Web Design 1-2
Copy your webpage from *Web Design 1.1* to the *Web Design 1.2* assignment folder. Use the skills you learned from the *Resources 1.2* folder and lecture 1.2 to improve your resume website. Create another web page and link to it from your main web page. The two pages should be linked together and have a table and at least one image added to one of them. All of these pages should be in a folder on your github pages called "1-2."

### Web Design 1-3
Use the skills you learned from the *Resources 1.3*  and lecture 1.3 to create a basic web site (multiple web pages linked together) for a new coffee shop named *Brewed Awakening*. The website should have images, basic colors, headlines, tables, paragraphs, and lists in a coherent layout. All of these pages should be in a folder on your github pages called "1-3."
